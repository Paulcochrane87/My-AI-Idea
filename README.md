# TimeBot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
My project is called TimeBot, and it is an AI-powered chatbot that syncs timecard data from staff submitting and approving timecards in Salesforce and follows up with team members on Microsoft Teams.


## Background
The problem my idea will solve is the inefficiency and inaccuracy of manual time tracking and reporting. This problem is very common and frequent, especially for remote workers and freelancers who have to log their hours and tasks on different platforms. My personal motivation is to simplify and automate this process, and save time and money for both employees and employers. This topic is important and interesting because time tracking is essential for project management, billing, and payroll, and it affects the productivity and satisfaction of workers.

## How is it used?
The context in which my solution is used is in the workplace, either remotely or in-office, by the staff and the managers. The staff use the chatbot to submit and approve their timecards, ask questions, get feedback, and receive reminders and notifications. The managers use the chatbot to monitor and manage the timecard data, and generate reports and invoices. The people affected by it are the staff, the managers, the clients, and the time tracking app providers.

## Data sources and AI methods
My project depends on the data sources from Salesforce and Microsoft Teams, as well as the time tracking apps Timely or Memtime. These data sources provide the information about the projects, tasks, hours, and status of the timecards. The AI techniques that I think will be helpful are natural language processing, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. Natural language processing is used to interact with the staff and the time tracking app using text or voice. Speech recognition is used to convert voice commands or queries into text. Sentiment analysis is used to detect the emotions and attitudes of the staff and provide appropriate responses.

## Challenges
My project does not solve the problems of trust, privacy, and security. It is important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations, and that human oversight and intervention are still necessary. For example, the chatbot might not be able to handle complex or ambiguous requests, or it might make errors or misinterpretations. The staff might not trust the chatbot or the time tracking app, or they might feel monitored or pressured. The project should address these challenges by ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the chatbot, providing clear and transparent information and options to the staff, and respecting the privacy and security of the data.

## What next?
My project could grow and become something even more by adding more features and functionalities, such as:

Integrating with other platforms and tools, such as Google Calendar, Slack, Zoom, etc.
Providing analytics and insights, such as trends, patterns, and recommendations.
Offering gamification and rewards, such as badges, points, and bonuses.
Supporting multiple languages and cultures, such as localization and translation.
